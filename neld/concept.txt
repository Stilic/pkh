- Base similar to Chimera's: Musl, LLVM (allow GCC to be used for e.g. Haxe), Dinit (could write a new init system for fun but that's a pain in the ass)
- PacK Head (package manager handled with Lua for packages definitions / system configuration and eventually Nim for native parts)
- Atomic / immutable (whole system except the home directory is read-only, rebuilding is done in a separate environement to keep the current one as it is until it's done)
- Always reproductible setup, inspired by NixOS (not possible to install packages temporarily unless if it's done in a wrapped environement, like `nix-shell` but there's not `nix-env` equivalent)
- FHS compatible (allows you to use abitrary binaries without any additional configuration)
